Octave Snapshot
===============

This project has been migrated to another location and broken up into
components.

* [mtmiller/octave-snapshot on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/mtmiller/octave-snapshot)
  continues the work of building a source or binary
  [GNU Octave](https://www.octave.org) distribution from a particular Hg
  revision or a released version number. This project's repository history and
  issues have been transferred there.

* [mtmiller/docker-octave on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/mtmiller/docker-octave)
  builds a Docker image that provides stable and development versions of
  Octave. Use [mtmiller/octave](https://hub.docker.com/r/mtmiller/octave) now.

* A new project will be created for the task of bringing up a VM or cloud
  compute resource and running
  [octave-snapshot](https://gitlab.com/mtmiller/octave-snapshot) on it.
